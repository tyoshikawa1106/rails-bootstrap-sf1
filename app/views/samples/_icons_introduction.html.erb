<h2 class="section-head">Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://sfdc-styleguide.herokuapp.com/">SFDC Salesforce1 styleguide</a> provides a number of new icons both for setting context and also for UI elements. As part of this project we are providing icon classes and styles more in the style of Bootstrap or Font Awesome to make inserting icons easier. As many of these icons are image based, you will not have the same level of customization in terms of sizing or coloring as you do with the font-based icons.</p>
